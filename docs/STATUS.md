# Netflux release and workstream status

**Latest production verification:** `d159c6f8` on 26 September 2026. Earlier delivery entries retain their own scope and evidence; the current retrieval release has the dated production proof below.

## Implemented on main

The [README](../README.md#what-ships-today) lists the product surfaces; [architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) describes their boundaries. The following recent deliveries are verified in repository history:

| Delivery | Merge evidence | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Account library access and verified hydration | [#137](https://github.com/Jseow008/ThePlayBook/pull/137), `faa7353` | Foundation for finding #7; export verification does not independently close every live-list or synchronization requirement. |
| Complete account export | [#138](https://github.com/Jseow008/ThePlayBook/pull/138), `c6847bb` | Finding #10 delivery; one verified cross-collection snapshot. |
| Separate export allowance, progress, refresh-safe delivery, and resume | [#139](https://github.com/Jseow008/ThePlayBook/pull/139), [#140](https://github.com/Jseow008/ThePlayBook/pull/140), [#141](https://github.com/Jseow008/ThePlayBook/pull/141), [#142](https://github.com/Jseow008/ThePlayBook/pull/142) | Resume reuses a valid server snapshot; the browser retains an opaque reference, not exported account data. |
| Catalog and Notes search | [#145](https://github.com/Jseow008/ThePlayBook/pull/145), `7f479ce` | Findings #2/#12/#13: server search before pagination, lexical ranking/snippets, and distinct errors. This is separate from generative personal retrieval. |
| Account-state/function ACL repairs | [#143](https://github.com/Jseow008/ThePlayBook/pull/143), [#146](https://github.com/Jseow008/ThePlayBook/pull/146) | Repairs are recorded deliveries, not proof against future ACL drift. |
| CI efficiency | [#148](https://github.com/Jseow008/ThePlayBook/pull/148), `6bfdb99` | Scope-aware verification and cancellation of superseded PR checks; required release gates remain. |
| Typed personal retrieval and evidence extracts | [#153](https://github.com/Jseow008/ThePlayBook/pull/153), `d159c6f8` | Findings #3/#4/#6 delivery; matched responses use attributed extracts. Broader synthesis and precise citation navigation remain separate. |
| Database-native snapshot maintenance | Reviewed [#154](https://github.com/Jseow008/ThePlayBook/pull/154), shipped in #153 | Private hourly Supabase Cron replaces the failing HTTP worker; #154 is closed as superseded. |
| Replayable deployed book identity schema | [#155](https://github.com/Jseow008/ThePlayBook/pull/155), `7ff1dd98` | Records existing production ISBN/identity definitions and grants; preserves publishing compatibility. |

Earlier export/resume handoffs reported production smoke success. The current release verification below does not rerun every earlier workstream; confirm the deployed commit and environment when making a new operational decision.

## Current retrieval release

PR #153 shipped typed highlights, notes and reflections with attributed evidence extracts. The historical generated-answer candidate failed grounding (86/90); it remains evidence against releasing broader synthesis. All 90 replacement extract responses were independently reviewed. Frozen diagnostic thresholds pass, with the three known irrelevant selections still counted as failures.

The combined release passed a data-less hosted 105-migration replay, matching production schema/type contracts, six security checks, targeted database behavior tests, and all seven application smoke checks. All three reviewed migrations are applied; the follow-up production dry-run is clean and 46 existing captures are indexed and ready. The candidate's hourly Cron tick and a manual production maintenance run succeeded. The first production scheduled tick was not separately awaited.

Vercel deployed `d159c6f8`. Live authenticated empty-scope retrieval returned 200 and the same session returned 401 after actual revocation; the temporary account was removed. The index worker's production-credential GitHub dispatch passed. Health and Browse returned 200. Details and retained evidence: [personal retrieval checkpoint](PHASE_1_PERSONAL_RETRIEVAL.md#production-release-continuation--26-september-2026). The hosted branch, credentials and isolated services were removed.

## Deferred and separately open

- Validated citations and exact-passage navigation (#5) follow the typed retrieval contract; existing reader links are not proof of that workstream.
- Broader durability (#8/#9), AI safeguards (#20–#24), remaining operational proof, and later product experiments retain their acceptance obligations in the [32-finding register](PHASE_1_TRUSTWORTHY_RETRIEVAL_CONTRACT.md#5-finding-register).
- The retrieval work recorded an account-deletion/revision-trigger defect during disposable cleanup. Removing fixture library rows before deleting its account was a cleanup workaround, not a production fix; track it with the durability workstream.

## Updating this page

Record a delivery with its PR/commit and scope. Mark production verification separately with dated evidence. Use the existing workstream document for detailed checkpoints rather than adding transcript-sized logs here. The old [docs/AGENT.md](AGENT.md) path is a compatibility pointer; agent instructions live only in root [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).
